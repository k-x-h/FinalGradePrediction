# Final Grade Prediction




## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the final grade of a student based on a ["Student Performance Data Set"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) from the [University of California, Irvine (UCI) Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems](https://cml.ics.uci.edu/), using exploratory data analysis, in additional to comparing multiple linear models to see which is best fit.

## tl;dr 
Peformed EDA and tested multiple linear models to find which model best suited for the prediction of a student's final grade.

## Conclusion
Based on the models tested, Random Forest Regressor had the lowest error, and thus would be the most preferable model for use in this situation.
