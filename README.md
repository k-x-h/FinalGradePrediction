# Final Grade Prediction

This project aims to predict the final grade of a student based on a ["Student Performance Data Set"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) from the [University of California, Irvine (UCI) Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems](https://cml.ics.uci.edu/), using exploratory data analysis, in additional to comparing multiple linear models to see which is best fit.
